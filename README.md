## NFC Tag Operations

## How It Works  
1. Write application info to pair **Number Tags** (Server Tag and Customer Tag) or a **Customer QR code**:  
   - Go to: **Shops > [Shop] > Shop Settings > Manage Number Tags > [Manage Number Tag]**.  
2. Scan a **Server Tag** in the **Scan** tab.  
3. View the updated **Number Tags** status in the **Shop Detail** screen or on the **Number Tags Webpage** (see Background Tag Reading GIF below).  

### Recommended NFC Tags  
For best performance, use **NTAG215 (540 bytes)** tags.  
Example: [50pcs NFC Cards Ntag215](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087FRYY8S) (Amazon USA).

### Background Tag Reading  

![Gif showing Background Tag Reading](https://github.com/nativeapptemplate/NativeAppTemplate-Free-Android/blob/main/docs/images/nfc.gif "Showing Background Tag Reading")  

1. Scan a Server Tag.  
2. View the updated Number Tags status in the **Shop Detail** screen or on the **Number Tags Webpage**.  

The **Number Tags Webpage** updates in real-time using Rails [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev).  
This functionality is available in:  
- [NativeAppTemplate-API (Solo)](https://nativeapptemplate.com/products/api-solo)  
- [NativeAppTemplate-API (Team)](https://nativeapptemplate.com/products/api-team)
